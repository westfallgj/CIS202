* accumulator
total
running total
summer

Question 2: A(n) __________ structure is a structure that causes a statement or a set of statements to execute repeatedly.

sequence
decision
module
* repetition

Question 3: In Python, a comma-separated sequence of data items that are enclosed in a set of brackets is called

sequence
variable
value
* list

Question 4: In Python, the variable in the for clause is referred to as the __________ because it is the target of an assignment at the beginning of each loop iteration.

* target variable
loop variable
for variable
count variable

Question 5: The first operation is called the __________ and its purpose is to get the first input value that will be tested by the validation loop.

*priming read
first input
loop set read
loop validation

Question 6: What are the values that the variable num contains through the iterations of the following for loop?
for num in range(4):

1, 2, 3, 4
0, 1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3
* 0, 1, 2, 3

Question 7: What are the values that the variable num contains through the iterations of the following for loop?
for num in range(2, 9, 2):

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
2, 5, 8
* 2, 4, 6, 8
1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Question 8: What does the following program do?

student = 1
while student <= 3:
    total = 0
    for score in range(1, 4):
        score = int(input("Enter test score: "))
        total += score
    average = total/3
    print("Student ", student, "average: ", average)
    student += 1

It accepts 4 test scores for 3 students and outputs the average of the 12 scores.
* It accepts 3 test scores for each of 3 students and outputs the average for each student.
It accepts 4 test scores for 2 students, then averages and outputs all the scores.
It accepts one test score for each of 3 students and outputs the average of the 3 scores.
