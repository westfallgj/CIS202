### Beginner Python Final Exam Study Guide

This study guide is based on the provided documents: "Exam1 Practice Problem.pdf", "Final Exam Practice Problem 2.txt", "quiz.txt", "quiz3.txt", "quiz10.txt", "quiz4.txt", "quiz5.txt", "quiz6.txt", "quiz7.txt", "quiz8.txt", and "quiz9.txt".

**1. Functions**

*   **Function Definition and Structure:**
    *   A set of statements that belong together and contribute to the function definition.
    *   The first line is the **function header**, and the set of statements is the **block**.
*   **Main Function and Function Calls:**
    *   You should have at least a `main` function that calls one or more other functions.
    *   The `main` function should perform actions beyond just printing.
    *   Other functions should also perform calculations or actions beyond just printing, unless they are dedicated to printing results.
*   **Arguments and Parameters:**
    *   An **argument** is any piece of data passed into a function when it's called.
    *   A **parameter** is a variable inside the function that receives the argument.
*   **Value-Returning Functions:**
    *   A function that returns a value back to the part of the program that called it.
    *   Use the `return` keyword followed by an expression; the value of the expression is sent back.
*   **Variable Scope:**
    *   A **local variable** is created inside a function. Its **scope** (the function in which it's created) limits its accessibility.
    *   A **global variable** is accessible to all functions in a program file.
    *   It is **recommended to avoid using global variables** whenever possible.
*   **The `pass` keyword:** Ignored by the interpreter, can be used as a placeholder for future code.
*   **Modules:**
    *   The `math` module contains functions for mathematical calculations.
    *   The `random` module contains functions for random number generation.
    *   Use the `import` statement (e.g., `import random`) to load module contents.
    *   `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive.
    *   `floor(x)` returns the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

**2. Control Structures (Decisions)**

*   **What are Control Structures?** A logical design controlling the order of statement execution.
*   **Boolean Variables and Values:** A Boolean variable references one of two values: `True` or `False`.
*   **Comparison Operators:**
    *   Equality: `==`
    *   Not-equal-to: `!=` or `<>`
    *   Less than or equal to: `<=`
    *   Greater than: `>`
    *   Less than: `<`
    *   Greater than or equal to: `>=`
*   **Logical Operators:** Combine multiple Boolean expressions.
    *   `and`: Both subexpressions must be `True` for the compound expression to be `True`. Performs short-circuit evaluation.
    *   `or`: One or both subexpressions must be `True` for the compound expression to be `True`. Performs short-circuit evaluation.
    *   `not`: Reverses the Boolean value of an expression.
*   **Decision Structures (`if-else`):** Have two possible paths of execution (dual alternative).
    *   Correct syntax to check if `points` is **outside** the range 1 to 10: `if points < 1 or points > 10:`.
    *   Correct syntax to check if `y` is in the range 10 through 50 **inclusive**: `if y >= 10 and y <= 50:`.
    *   Correct syntax to check if `choice` is **anything other than 10**: `if choice != 10:`.
*   **Nested Decision Structures:** Placing decision structures inside other decision structures. For example, checking if `amount1` is greater than 10 AND `amount2` is less than 100, THEN displaying the lesser of the two amounts.

**3. Loops (Repetition Structures)**

*   **What are Repetition Structures?** Structures that cause a statement or set of statements to execute repeatedly.
*   **Types of Loops:**
    *   **Condition-controlled loop:** Repeats based on the value of a Boolean expression (`while` loop).
    *   **Count-controlled loop:** Repeats a specific number of times (`for` loop in many cases).
*   **`while` loops:**
    *   Terminate when the loop's Boolean expression becomes `False`.
    *   A common pattern is using a **priming read** before the loop to get the first value to be tested.
*   **`for` loops:**
    *   The variable in the `for` clause is the **target variable**.
    *   The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. `range(stop)` generates 0 up to `stop - 1`. `range(start, stop, step)` generates numbers starting at `start`, up to `stop - 1`, incrementing by `step`.
*   **Accumulators:** A variable used to keep a **running total**.
*   **Augmented Assignment Operators:** Combine an operation with assignment (e.g., `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`). `total += number` is the correct way to accumulate.
*   **Input Validation:** Inspecting input data to ensure it's valid before use.

**4. Data Structures**

*   **Lists**
    *   A comma-separated sequence of data items enclosed in brackets `[]`.
    *   Individual data items are called **elements**.
    *   **Mutable:** Can be changed after creation.
    *   **Indexing:** Access elements by position (index). The first index is `0`. The first negative index is `-1`.
    *   **List Comprehensions:** A concise way to create lists based on existing sequences.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   Concatenation: Use the `+` operator.
        *   Multiplication: Use the `*` operator to repeat the list.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `append(item)`: Adds an item to the end.
        *   `insert(index, item)`: Adds an item at a specific index.
        *   `remove(value)`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
    *   **Removing Elements:** Use a `del` statement to remove an element by index.
    *   **Converting:** Can be converted to a tuple using `tuple(list_name)` and a tuple to a list using `list(tuple_name)`.
*   **Tuples**
    *   Similar to lists, but the primary difference is that **once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed (immutable)**.
    *   An advantage of using a tuple is that **processing is faster** than processing a list.
    *   Can include any data type as elements.
    *   Can be converted to a list using `list(tuple_name)`.
*   **Strings**
    *   Sequences of characters.
    *   **Indexing:** Access characters by position (index). Valid indexes for 'New York' are 0 through 7, or -1 through -8. The first negative index is `-1`.
    *   **Slicing:** Extract substrings using `[start:end:step]`. If the start index is greater than or equal to the end index, the slice returns an empty string.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   Concatenation: Use the `+` operator or `+=`.
        *   Multiplication: Use the `*` operator to repeat the string.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `lstrip()`: Returns the string with all **leading whitespaces** removed.
        *   `split(delimiter)`: Splits the string into a list using the specified delimiter.
        *   `upper()`: Returns an uppercase version.
        *   `isalpha()`: Checks if all characters are alphabetic.
        *   `isdigit()`: Checks if all characters are digits.
        *   `isupper()`: Checks if all characters are uppercase.
        *   `endswith(substring)`: Determines if the string ends with a substring.
        *   `startswith(substring)`: Determines if the string starts with a substring.
        *   `find(substring)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
        *   `replace(old, new)`: Returns a string with occurrences of `old` replaced by `new`.
*   **Dictionaries**
    *   A collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
    *   You use a **key** to locate a specific **value**.
    *   Dictionaries are **not indexed by number**.
    *   The elements are **unordered**.
    *   **Operations:**
        *   Checking for keys: Use the `in` operator to avoid `KeyError` exceptions.
        *   Adding/Modifying: Assign a value to a key (e.g., `dict_name[key] = value`).
        *   Deleting: Use the `del` keyword with the key (e.g., `del dict_name[key]`).
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `get(key, default_value)`: Returns the value for the key, or a default value if the key is not found.
        *   `pop(key)`: Gets the value associated with a specific key AND **removes that key-value pair**.
        *   `items()`: Returns all elements as a list of tuples (key, value).
        *   `keys()`: Returns a view of the keys.
        *   `values()`: Returns a view of the values.
    *   **Length:** Use `len(dictionary_name)` to get the number of elements.
    *   A `KeyError` occurs when you try to access a key that doesn't exist.
    *   **Dictionary Comprehensions:** A concise way to create dictionaries.
*   **Sets**
    *   Used to store unique elements.
    *   Can be used to display unique values from a list.
    *   Elements are **unordered**.
    *   Elements are **not in pairs** (unlike dictionaries).
    *   Can store elements of different data types.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `add(item)`: Adds a single element.
        *   `update(collection)`: Adds a group of elements.
    *   **Length:** Use `len(set_name)` to get the number of elements.
    *   Remember to handle trailing newlines if reading values from a file into a set.

**5. File I/O and Error Handling**

*   **File Basics:**
    *   Opening a file creates a connection between the file and the program and associates it with a **file object**.
    *   A single piece of data within a record is called a **field**.
*   **File Modes:**
    *   `'r'`: **Read** mode. Opens for reading, cannot change or write. Correct open: `open('filename', 'r')`.
    *   `'w'`: **Write** mode. Opens for writing. If the file exists, it **erases its contents**. If it doesn't exist, it creates it. Correct open: `open('filename', 'w')`.
    *   `'a'`: **Append** mode. Opens for writing. If the file exists, new data is written to the end. If it doesn't exist, it creates it.
*   **Reading from Files:**
    *   The process of retrieving data from a file.
    *   `read()` method: Returns the file's entire contents as a string.
    *   `readline()` method: Reads a single line.
    *   When reading beyond the end of a file, the `readline()` method returns an **empty string**.
*   **Writing to Files:**
    *   Data is copied from a **variable in RAM** to a file.
    *   Use the `write(string)` method of the file object. Remember to convert non-string data to strings using `str()`.
*   **File Access Types:**
    *   **Sequential access:** Data is read from the beginning to the end.
    *   **Random access** (also known as **direct access**): Jumps directly to a piece of data.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Use a **`try/except` statement** to handle runtime errors.
    *   You can catch specific error types, like `ZeroDivisionError` (occurs when dividing by zero) or `ValueError` (occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value, e.g., converting "-5" to int for a number of items).
*   **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:** A common structure to ensure code runs only when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).

**6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

*   **Definition:** A programming paradigm that contains **class definitions**.
*   **Encapsulation:** Combining data and code (methods) in a single object.
*   **Classes vs. Objects:**
    *   Programmers first identify the **classes** needed.
    *   A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.
    *   An **object** (or **instance**) is a self-contained unit that consists of **data attributes** and the **methods** that operate on those attributes.
*   **Class Definition:**
    *   The first line is `class ClassName:`.
*   **Data Attributes:**
    *   Represent the data that belongs to an object.
    *   Attributes that belong to a **specific instance** are instance attributes.
    *   Represented in the **second section** of a UML diagram.
*   **Methods:**
    *   The **procedures** that an object performs.
    *   Defined within the class.
    *   Represented in the **third section** of a UML diagram.
*   **Instance Methods:** Methods that operate on a specific instance's data. They take `self` as the first parameter, referring to the instance itself.
*   **Creating Instances:** Use the class name followed by parentheses (e.g., `object_joey = Worker()`).
*   **Special Methods:**
    *   `__init__`: The **constructor** method. Automatically executed when an instance of a class is created. Used to initialize the object's attributes.
    *   `__str__`: Automatically called when you pass an object as an argument to the `print` function. It should return a string containing the object's state.
*   **Accessor and Mutator Methods:**
    *   **Accessor methods** (also known as **getters**) provide a safe way to retrieve the values of attributes from outside the class without exposing the attributes directly.
    *   **Mutator methods** (also known as **setters**) provide a controlled way to change the values of attributes.
*   **Passing Objects as Arguments:** When an object is passed as an argument, a **reference to the object** is passed into the parameter variable.
