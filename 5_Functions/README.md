Problem 1

Write a program that validates input values using one function that is called from the main function. 
Ask the user to enter hours and minutes and the program should use one function to validate if the hours 
are between 0 and 23 and the minutes are between 0 and 59. Program output should indicate the number of 
hours and minutes and the input validation function should keep asking the user to enter valid values. 

There should be a main function that should call only one other function to validate both the hours and minutes values. 

See sample output below.
