Assume each pizza has 8 slices. Assuming that there is a family of 4. Ask how many slices everyone in the family eats. Then calculate how many whole pizzas are required for a family of 4 for one meal? How many are the leftover slices? So if everyone is eating 3 slices you need 2 pizzas with 4 leftover slices. Do not use loops or lists or functions. In this case write two programs one with everyone eating the same number of slices and another with everyone eating different number of slices.

Also submit a document that specifies the following

    Input: What are the inputs?
    Processing: What is the processing you are doing?
    Output: What is the output?
    Assumptions: What are the assumptions you are making or the problem statement is making? What will happen when you change the assumptions? For example what if it is a square pizza? Can you think of anything else?

Test cases: Test these 4 test cases for the program where everyone eats the same number of slices. What if everyone eats 0 slices of pizza? What if they eat -1 slices each? What if they eat 2 slices each? What if they eat 3 slices each? For the purpose of this chapter the program should work  for any of these test cases except for the -1.

Deliverables

1. 2 python files.

2. Screenshot of code for the 2 programs and 4 screenshots of outputs for all the 4 test cases. These screenshots should be a part of the same word or google docs document. Do not submit them as separate jpg files.

3. Answer questions 1 through 4 above

Guidelines

1. Make sure your screenshots are readable

2. If you submit multiple screenshots in separate files they should be labeled like test case 0, test case -1 or something that is obvious so I can grade them
