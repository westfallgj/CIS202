Here are all of them:

& (ampersand) - bitwise conjunction;    x = x&y     x &= y
| (bar) - bitwise disjunction;          x = x|y     x |= y
~ (tilde) - bitwise negation; 
^ (caret) - bitwise exclusive or (xor)  x = x^y     x ^=y

Bitwise operations (&, |, and ^)
Argument A	    Argument B	    A & B	    A | B	    A ^ B
0	            0	            0	        0	        0
0	            1	            0	        1	        1
1	            0	            0	        1	        1
1	            1	            1	        1	        0

Bitwise operations (~)
Argument	~ Argument
0	            1
1	            0

Let's make it easier:

& requires exactly two 1s to provide 1 as the result;
| requires at least one 1 to provide 1 as the result;
^ requires exactly one 1 to provide 1 as the result.
