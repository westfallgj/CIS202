Problem 1: 70 points

One cause for speeding is the desire to shorten the time spent traveling. 
Create a program that calculates the amount of time saved if you are traveling 
with an average speed that is above the speed-limit as compared to traveling 
with an average speed exactly at the speed-limit. As the user for the average 
speed in miles per hour, speed limit in miles per hour and distance traveled 
in miles. THE TIME SAVED SHOULD BE REPORTED IN MINUTES. Create a screenshot of 
output where your average speed is 80 mph, speed limit is 60 mph and distance 
traveled is 100 miles. Your answer should indicate that you saved 25 minutes
