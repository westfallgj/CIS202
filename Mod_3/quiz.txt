Question 1
Write an if-else statement that determines whether the points variable is outside 
the range of 1 to 10. If the variable’s value is outside this range it should display 
“Invalid points.” Otherwise, it should display “Valid points.”
  
if points < 1 or points > 10:
print ('Invalid points')
else:
print ('Valid points')

    if points < 1 and points > 10:
    print ('Invalid points')
    else:
    print ('Valid points')

    if points > 1 or points < 10:
    print ('Invalid points')
    else:
    print ('Valid points')
